In the future, we look forward to seeing what new experiences and games our community can create to expand the possibilities of the metaverse. The tools and utility of Otherside will be continually and iteratively shaped by the participation and needs of our community.

As a Voyager, you will have genuine ownership and control over a Plot. What you do on the Plot is your choice (within community informed guidelines). Your actions have the potential to influence the inherent utility of its natural resources, any items you craft, and whatever sweet loot you might stumble across in your adventures. Otherside will support interoperability in the future, giving Voyagers a chance to bring their own outside collections and NFTs to life within our metaverse. Voyagers will also be able to share experiences and creations between their lands through linking them.

Places - Worlds you can travel between with common game systems. Things - Interoperable objects, avatars, wearables, items you can take between places - within the Otherside, and beyond. Otherside is built by developers and Voyagers together, so to make sure everything works properly with each other there needs to be rules we can all follow - Open Object Standards.',
  },
  {
    subtitle: 'OPEN OBJECT STANDARDS',
    text: 'We want things made with our Creation Tools to be interoperable - they can be used anywhere within Otherside - or any other metaverse that conforms to these standards. To achieve this we’re working with Improbable’s M² Network to create a set of Open Object Standards that describe what objects are, what they look like, and how they behave: Metadata Ontology - We will allow objects to be tagged using descriptors from the Otherside Metadata Ontology, enabling common gameplay behavior. Examples: tagging an object as a chair allows it to be sat on, tagging an object as a ball allows it to be picked up and thrown. Metadata tags will follow the ERC-721 metadata JSON standard. 2D Images - We support common image formats, starting with PNG, JPG - with more being added as Voyagers request them. 3D Objects - We support 3D models through the popular glTF format (which includes meshes, materials, cameras, textures, animations, and everything you need to make a complete model). These objects can respond to in-engine lighting and physics. Universal Scripting System - We will support scripts to be attached to objects and worlds to define and extend their behavior. The current prototype uses JavaScript and is undergoing large-scale testing. Objects built using this open standard will be fully supported within Otherside, any M² metaverse network project, and any outside project that adopts this standard. In order to create objects within Otherside you need to do two things. First: Author or Obtain a Template of the object, and Second: Manufacture the object using Resources.', 
  },
  {
    subtitle: 'AUTHORING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES',
    img: eleventh,
    text: 'There are two types of primary processes that form the basis of the ODK tools: Authoring Tools - Easy-to-use, in-world tools that let you collaboratively bring assets together and compose them into templates for interoperable objects. Templates can be shared, traded, or sold between Voyagers. Creating a template doesn’t cost any Resources. Here are some theoretical examples of templates: A smart 3D object that makes noise when a player walks by A tool to import images into stickers Creating the architectural blueprints for your own personal room or structure An object that follows people around looking for attention We believe Voyagers will come up with a wide variety of useful and fun new Templates that other players will enjoy Manufacturing with. Manufacturing Tools - For an object to become real and permanent within Otherside it has to be Manufactured. To do this a Voyager collects Resources from around Otherside and combines them with a Template to create as many of that type of object as they’d like - so long as they have enough Resources to do it. When an object has been Manufactured it will be able to be used and interacted with in game. The Manufacturing process allows Voyagers to use Templates and create objects that work with Otherside’s interoperable standards, and with some performance optimizations automatically applied. Here are the current steps involved in Manufacturing: Optimization - Objects are passed through an automated optimization process that creates Levels of Detail (LODs), optimizes materials and shaders, and tests any script behaviors for performance issues. Moderation - Objects are passed through a moderation process using established guidelines. Items must pass community and safety guidelines before moving on Tags are applied to the content accordingly, e.g.: explicit, NSFW, etc. Voyagers will be able to set rules for their worlds on what level of moderated content is allowed. Resourcing - All objects require Resources to be Manufactured; Resources can be found on Plots, traded for, or earned through play (more details to come). The bigger and more complex an object is, the more Resources needed to Manufacture it. Imbuing - Some types of objects may optionally be imbued with special properties by Imbuing Resources as part of the Manufacturing process. This gives a chance for each object to get a random special property as it is Manufactured. The better the Resources used for imbuing the better the potential special properties. The Manufacturing Process is still very early in development and we expect many aspects of it will shift, change, and evolve as it gets used more and tested.',

As we continue to develop Otherside together, both in our marquee experiences and in the creations of our community of developers and players, there will be a growing and evolving supply and demand for the natural resources of Otherside based on the experiences that are created. We expect users and developers to use these resources to craft all kinds of amazing creations in our world and their own.
